             <p>Welcome to my portal, I'm glad you took the time to look through my web page and are currently reading this sentence! However, you may not know who I am. I will now proceed to share many words about myself.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, my name is Tawa. I'm 13 years old and I reside in New Zealand. I will not be informing you on my address, as this website is public and exposed to the entire internet.</p>
        </section>

        
        <section id="section3">
            <h3 id="myHeader2"><center><ins>MY INTERESTS</ins></center></h3>
              <p>I enjoy a wide variety of media/hobbies, in which I display with pride. Some of the things I currently enjoy include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Music: Marilyn Manson, Motionless In White, Black Veil Brides, Breach The Void, etc...</li>
    <li>Diptera (flies): Psychodidae, Cryptochetidae, Ceratopogonidae, Biblo Marci</li>
    <li>Video games: The Forest, Bully, Goat simulator</li>
    <li>Consuming Monster Energy</li>
    <li>Shopping</li>
    <li>Cardio</li>
    <li>Making waffles</li>
    <li>Horror movies: The Fly, Audition, Dawn Of The Dead, The Excorcist, Friday The 13th, Ringu</li>
    <li>Writing</li>
    <li>Coding</li>
  </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="section4">
            <h3 id="myHeader2"><center><ins>MY CONVICTIONS</ins></center></h3>
            
  <p>I am a very opinionated person, however that does NOT mean I have a closed mind. A quote that always sticks in my mind is "Open your mind before your mouth" - Chris Motionless". I was genuinely considering making that my yearbook quote. Yet I did not persue that in replacement for "Don't pick the scabs, or you will never heal - Marilyn Manson"</p>
  <br>
  <p>It is obvious that I am prone to inadvertantly digress. To which I sincerely apologize for... Nontheless, I cannot guarantee an end to my inconsistency.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>BACK TO THE CENTRAL TOPIC: MY BELIEFS:</h4>
  <p>Here is a list of my totally relevant beliefs</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I am currently an incapacitated worm, soon to develop into a powerful fly that beholds knowledge beyond all conceivable morality.</li>
    <li>Anarchy is good</li>
    <li>I am nihilistic</li>
    <li>Pineapple on pizza is great</li>
    <li>The Original Monster Energy variant is the best</li>
    <li>There's more to life than a 9-5 job</li>
    <li>There is no true God</li>
    <li>For you are your own God</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>I have absolutely no clue why I am sharing this information, but I hope that this entertains you</p>

       <section id="section5">
            <h3 id="myHeader2"><center><ins>THINGS I'M SKILLED AT</ins></center></h3>
               <p>Believe it or not, I am actually capable of providing satisfactory work in various different subjects. Most notably, I spent days upon days coding this super cool website. <br>
               I will now proceed to name my valuable qualities</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>I have an extensive knowledge of diptera (flies)</li>
                       <li>I am extremely passionate about the things I enjoy</li>
                       <li>I'm very firm with my belief while simultaneously keeping an open mind</li>
                       <li>I possess an amazing initiative</li>
                       <li>I can chug an entire can of Monster Energy in 7 seconds</li>
                       <li>I'm very wise with money (I only spend what I need)</li>
                       <li>I'm great at scheduling things</li>
                       <li>I acknowledge my imperfections and work towards resolving them</li>
                   </ul>
               <p>Although I may come off as a condescending narcissist, I am not! My flaws remain ubiquitous, soon to be resolved.</p>
