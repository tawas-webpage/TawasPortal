<h3 id="myHeader"><center><ins>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME</ins></center></h3>
  <p>Welcome to my portal, I'm glad you took the time to look through my web page and are currently reading this sentence! However, you may not know who I am. I will now proceed to share many words about myself.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, my name is Tawa. I'm 13 years old and I reside in New Zealand. I will not be informing you on my address, as this website is public and exposed to the entire internet.</p>

<h3 id="myHeader"><center><ins>MY CONVICTIONS</ins></center></h3>
  <p>I am a very opinionated person, however that does NOT mean I have a closed mind. A quote that always sticks in my mind is "Open your mind before your mouth" - Chris Motionless". I was genuinely considering making that my yearbook quote. Yet I did not persue that in replacement for "Don't pick the scabs, or you will never heal - Marilyn Manson"</p>
  <br>
  <p>It is obvious that I am prone to inadvertantly digress. To which I sincerely apologize for... Nontheless, I cannot guarantee an end to my inconsistency.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>BACK TO THE CENTRAL TOPIC: MY BELIEFS:</h4>
  <p>Here is a list of my totally relevant beliefs</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I am currently an incapacitated worm, soon to develop into a powerful fly that beholds knowledge beyond all conceivable morality.</li>
    <li>Anarchy is good</li>
    <li>I am nihilistic</li>
    <li>Pineapple on pizza is great</li>
    <li>The Original Monster Energy variant is the best</li>
    <li>There's more to life than a 9-5 job</li>
    <li>Marilyn Manson did nothing wrong</li>
    <li>There is no true God</li>
    <li>For you are your own God</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>I have absolutely no clue why I am sharing this information, but I hope that this entertains you</p>
