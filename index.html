  <p>Welcome to my portal, I'm glad you took the time to look through my web page and are currently reading this sentence! However, you may not know who I am. I will now proceed to share many words about myself.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, my name is Tawa. I'm 13 years old and I reside in New Zealand. I will not be informing you on my address, as this website is public and exposed to the entire internet.</p>

<h3 id="myHeader"><center><ins>MY CONVICTIONS</ins></center></h3>
  <p>I am a very opinionated person, however that does NOT mean I have a closed mind. A quote that always sticks in my mind is "Open your mind before your mouth" - Chris Motionless". I was genuinely considering making that my yearbook quote. Yet I did not persue that in replacement for "Don't pick the scabs, or you will never heal - Marilyn Manson"</p>
